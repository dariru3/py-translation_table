# translation_table

This repository contains a project developed using Google Apps Script (GAS) that aims to facilitate the translation of PDF documents by formatting text and organizing it into a table format, enabling human translators to work more efficiently.

Currently, text from a PDF has to be manually copied and pasted into a Google Doc to ensure the correct formatting order. Once the format is confirmed in the Google Doc, the script formats the text and sends it to a Google Spreadsheet. 

Please note, the project is still under development and improvements are being made.

## Getting Started

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Copy the script from the repository.
2. Paste the script into an empty Google Doc.
3. Manually copy and paste the text from a PDF into the Google Doc, ensuring correct formatting order.
4. Run the GAS script to format and send the text to a Google Spreadsheet.
